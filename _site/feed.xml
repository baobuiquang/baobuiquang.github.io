This drama brought up the topic of technology as its main theme. Interesting?! (That‚Äôs the reason why I decided to watch this film although I rarely concern about K-Drama.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../post_img/startup-kdrama-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start-up K-Drama&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëâ ‚ö† &lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert. I suggest that you should watch the film before reading this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of them participated in a fictional machine learning competition called CODA, which is based in Silicon Valley. While they didn‚Äôt expect much that they would win, they actually won it. SamsanTech gets famous. Investors visit their office to know more about their potential. However, all of the investors leave. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because SamsanTech doesn‚Äôt actually have a clear business plan at all. They just have what we call ‚Äúthe algorithm‚Äù, ‚Äúthe high-accuracy prototype‚Äù, ‚Äúthe machine learning technology‚Äù, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What Do-san and his friends care about: Optimize the algorithm, enhance the accuracy of the image recognition system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What investors care about: How this amazing technology can be monetized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors don‚Äôt understand why ‚Äúchanging the parameters or adding an extra layer to the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) improves its accuracy‚Äù. They only care that it works, that it‚Äôs applicable to the real world, and that it earns money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, what I got is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-brains-and-amazing-technology-arent-enough&quot;&gt;Great brains and amazing technology aren‚Äôt enough.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-start-up-needs-a-clear-goal-on-what-its-doing-and-how-it-will-generate-profit&quot;&gt;A start-up needs a clear goal on what it‚Äôs doing and how it will generate profit.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it‚Äôs a business, not a project in the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way (not relevant to this post), I must say one thing I don‚Äôt like about this film is that Han Ji‚Äëpyeong is not the male protagonist. However, I suggest this drama, you should have a try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bui Quang Bao</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="movie" /><category term="ai" /><summary type="html">Nam Do-san, Kim Yong-san and Lee Chul-san, three members of the SamsanTech, are working on computer vision - image recognition/classification, one field of artificial intelligence.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-prepare-your-package&quot;&gt;3. Prepare your package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put all your package‚Äôs files in 1 folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;üìÅyour-pkg-name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅyour-pkg-name-01

&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-publish-your-package&quot;&gt;4. Publish your package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxxndOskI1o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open command line and navigate to your package‚Äôs folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login your npm account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when you input the password, there is no clue show that you are typing. This will be confused if this is the first time you use the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initialize npm package manager:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have prepared your package, all you need to do is just enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publish your package:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm publish
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ your-pkg-name@1.0.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your package has been published on npm successfully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any error, you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check your package‚Äôs name, it maybe used by other user (for example: you can‚Äôt name your package &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vue&lt;/code&gt;, because they are already exist). In this case, you should change your package‚Äôs name, or publish your package under your name or organization‚Äôs name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check your folder‚Äôs structure and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check your npm account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Risk identification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a saying, ‚ÄúA plan has no chance when it meets reality.‚Äù I hope that doesn‚Äôt apply to your risk management. Here are some specific approaches I recommend to ensure your risk management plans effectively help you manage risks and their impacts on your project. Apply these as appropriate based on the type of project you‚Äôre running. First, seek out experienced project managers to participate in building or to review your risk identification list. Having people who‚Äôve been there and done that gives you a great advantage when building risk plans. You don‚Äôt want to call upon just any project manager however. Two sets of experience are most helpful. Finding a project manager who has worked with your specific client or area of the business before can give you valuable insights. Knowing your client‚Äôs risk sensitivities, those areas they‚Äôll be most concerned about, can focus your risk management planning. If you‚Äôre working in an industry or technology that‚Äôs new to you, find a project manager with that industry or technology experience. They can help you anticipate potential risks you might otherwise miss. My second real-world tip relates to those of you who are managing business process changes as part of your scope. Conduct a step-by-step process risk workshop. Gather your team together and brainstorm possible risks, examining your business processes step by step. While this may sound overly detailed, you‚Äôll be surprised how effective and efficient this can be. You end up surfacing risks that are very business focused which is extremely useful. And because there are several process steps you can skip over as you search for potential risks, the process risk brainstorming process doesn‚Äôt take as long as you might think. Finally, consider the immersion approach to risk identification. If you‚Äôre in construction or working on a project that‚Äôll be implemented in a specific environment, this is very effective at surfacing risks. Go to the location where your project will be implemented and immerse yourself in the environment. Spend time there to brainstorm your risks. A colleague of mine is in the mining industry. She won‚Äôt finalize her risk list without using the immersion approach. Seeing the environment, roads to and from the mine site, the attitude of the local community to the mine‚Äôs activities, and the nature of the terrain is invaluable to her. Although she could read schematics, industry reports, and study topographical maps, nothing surpasses being there. This is an underappreciated approach that also applies to projects where changes are anticipated for a specific business area. Go to the offices where the changes will be realized and get an understanding of the environment to identify potential risks. These techniques are useful to help you ensure your risk plan is pragmatic which is valuable to ensure you deliver your project successfully. And just maybe, your risk plans will indeed survive the clash with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-risk-analysis&quot;&gt;2. Risk analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real life is often a bit random, scattered, and even chaotic. While the steps for managing risk, identification, analysis, and response, flow nicely on paper, when working with stakeholders on a live project, things can jump around. As you start to analyze the risks you‚Äôve identified, people will try to derive response approaches or jump back to identifying more risks. Don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs okay. Here are a few very common instances when the risk management process doesn‚Äôt flow smoothly. These occur during real world risk analysis processing and you need to be sure the conversations don‚Äôt become too chaotic. First, your team may leap to conclusions and decide to change scope to avoid identified risks. As you start to discuss risks, your stakeholders may determine that some risks will likely have a high impact for your project. Almost always your team will start to determine ways to respond to the risk. If you find a reasonable way to address the risks, your team will move on. If not, it‚Äôs common for the team to talk about a different way to address project scope or even reduce scope to avoid the risk. Let them go through this process. Otherwise, you might have distracted stakeholders who aren‚Äôt engaged in assessing other risks as they keep thinking about this dangerous risk that might hurt your project. Second thing to look for, determining that risk is low impact without thorough analysis. Beware of instances where your team believes a risk is low impact, but they have not discussed the possibilities thoroughly. You should guide your team to look at all the ways a risk can impact your project. Ensure you look at scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Third, watch for risks that are improperly discarded because your team considers the risk too difficult to address. Your job as a project manager is to ensure your team pays appropriate attention to the risks you‚Äôve identified. When you believe a risk is being discarded because handling it‚Äôs too hard, it‚Äôs time for you to restore discipline. Ensure an assessment of the risk potential impacts and the probability of occurrence are captured. You can do research to prepare to address the risk during the response stage of risk management. These, and how to address other issues with risk analysis in the real world are flow-charted in a template I‚Äôve included in the exercise files for the course. Discussing risk often surfaces emotions, which can reduce your team‚Äôs sense of discipline. Let people surface their concerns and jump around with their thoughts, but be sure the appropriate risk analysis is completed and you‚Äôll be prepared to handle risks on your project. And if you do that well, you‚Äôll have a little less chaos in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-risk-response&quot;&gt;3. Risk response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked into a room, flipped on the light switch, and nothing happens? You end up stumbling around, disoriented, trying to find a light source so you can see what you‚Äôre doing. Unfortunately, that type of thing happens often when risk response sessions don‚Äôt yield the proper results. A risk occurs, you invoke a response plan you and your team have agreed upon, and nothing happens. The risk still proceeds to impact your project and you stumble around looking for other solutions. You can avoid this unfortunate fate by being aware of certain real-world occurrences. Here are a few to look out for. You proceed without agreement. While you discuss and write down a response to a risk, your team doesn‚Äôt fully agree. This could be because they have not thought of something better, they don‚Äôt believe the risk will actually occur, or they don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôll be responsible for implementing the response solution. Ensure you poll your critical team members and confirm that they agree each risk response is doable and will legitimately address the risk. Your risk responses are business-as-usual activities. At times, people will suggest typical project management activities like draft and execute a communication plan as a response to a project risk. Risks are events that will occur despite the business-as-usual activities you engage in as a project manager. So using a standard tool is not a viable response approach. Ensure your team goes above and beyond the use of standard project artifacts when creating a risk response approach. Your risk responses create other risks and you fail to account for these new risks. For example, your risk response may be to hire a vendor to perform a task you would normally perform in-house. Should you need to execute that response plan, then you‚Äôll have vendor management-related risks you might not otherwise have in your plan. You neglect to include risk triggers in your response plan. While you might have created a sound response action for a risk, it does not become a response plan until you identify any indication a risk might be occurring and the timing for executing your risk response. For example, a complete risk response with a trigger and timing would be: should vendor X miss two deadlines, we will contract a back-up vendor on Y date. To help you review the integrity of risk responses, I‚Äôve provided a checklist of these and other risk response issues in the exercise files for this course. Risk response management is a critical exercise to maintain the viability of your project. With a bit of diligence, you can ensure your responses always shine a light on the right way to handle the risks that surface on your project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Risk management in reporting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once had the hair-raising task of taking 12 kids camping. Getting everyone‚Äôs attention, then successfully communicating when I was needing them to hear was one of the biggest challenges of my life. You wouldn‚Äôt think communicating something on a project would be as difficult as working with those kids. However, communicating something as comprehensive as the risk on your project can be a far-reaching and tedious task. Incorporating risk management into your regular reporting approach is a great way to bring your risk management to light and keep a bit of balance in your own life. Here are some tips to do that. First and foremost, put a risk section in your regular status report. Discuss what you‚Äôve accomplished, deadlines you might have missed, and risk mitigation tasks you‚Äôre going to be tackling in the next reporting period. Status reporting should be concise, consistent, and frequent. So should your references to risk. Documenting risks in your status report ensures you‚Äôre communicating the risk to your project team, keeping your sponsor up to date on the true position of your project, preparing stakeholders for any corrective action you may need to take, and shows you‚Äôre planning ahead. The second way to incorporate risk management in your reporting is to use your project schedule. It‚Äôs a good practice to associate risks with tasks. Using dates from your project schedule, you can create sections in your schedule or risk response plan for risks that have been bypassed, that you must be aware of in the moment, and that you‚Äôll be looking at in future periods. A third technique is to distribute significant parts of your risk response plan. Highlights the risks you‚Äôre currently focused on and provide details to stakeholders that can help you detect and manage them. This is particularly helpful if you need to provide more detail on your risks or your organization has a particular sensitivity to a certain risk. For example, if your organization is sensitive to schedule risk, you might have a separate, detailed report to indicate when your schedule has varied from the plan. You can include details as to why it‚Äôs varied and any specific actions you‚Äôre planning to get you back on schedule. During times when there are lots of schedule risks, your risk response plan extract can go even further. You can detail the risk triggers and the actions to take if the risk triggers are noticed. It‚Äôs also useful to make note of any meetings or communications that happen around the risks, such as a phone call or email. This basically highlights how you‚Äôre managing the risk throughout your project. Make the effort to focus on your risk reporting, and you‚Äôll likely be able to suggest the best way to enhance or avoid most any risk that can surface on your project, and none of your kids or project stakeholders will get lost in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-when-to-execute-a-risk-response&quot;&gt;2. When to execute a risk response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author Mandy Hale has said, ‚ÄúPick your battles. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to show up ‚Äúfor every argument you‚Äôre invited to.‚Äù So it goes with project risk responses. Executing every risk response action all the time will drive everyone crazy and take up precious time and money. Project managers who understand when to execute a risk response and when to hold off are the most effective when managing their projects. There are three ways to approach the execution of your risk response actions. The first is to execute proactively. For example, in a component design and assembly project, you may believe there‚Äôs a risk in making a telephone component out of fiberglass because you may need a solution that‚Äôs going to be more rigid. So using steel to make the component has been proposed as a response action. You can address this risk proactively by spending the money and time to have sample fiberglass components manufactured ahead of time. From these samples, you can determine if the rigidity risk is likely to occur. Basically, you‚Äôre trying to balance your triple constrains, time, scope, and cost. Being proactive and doing something ahead of time typically gives you the best result when it comes to risk management. But it can have drawbacks in costs and potentially time. Second, use an assess and respond approach. You test the fiberglass parts at the prescribed time in your schedule and then you decide on the immediate actions to take based on the results. If the fiberglass works well, you don‚Äôt spend any money on a response action you don‚Äôt need. If the risk is valid and the fiberglass is too flexible, you spend the money to correct situation by using steel. Going down this assess and respond route could cost you nothing if it works. But if the result isn‚Äôt the level of quality you need, you could incur triple constraint impacts when you least need those challenges. Consider your options carefully. The third option is to be reactive, you change something after the impact of the risk has been felt. If the fiberglass isn‚Äôt acceptable once you deploy it, then you correct it after installation. This will probably involve some additional testing processes and coming up with something like reinforcing the fiberglass part. It can also upset your client and your reputation. In this case, we‚Äôve let the risk pan out and then reacted to it. This is not typically a good option, but can be considered for very low probability or low-cost risks. Whatever the case, it pays to analyze your risk before deciding which way to execute your response to maintain the integrity of your project. Assess the impact of the risk. Look at how much control you need to put in place and when to get the optimal risk management result. And share your thoughts with your stakeholders so you don‚Äôt trigger stakeholder risks and arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-assess-overall-project-risk&quot;&gt;3. Assess overall project risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren‚Äôt careful, you can create a substantial risk while managing risk on your project. While you deal with risks that are tied to tasks, you can forget what you‚Äôre really here for: to deliver an entire project. We need to step back and see, as they say, the forest through the trees. We need to assess overall project risk. There are two major considerations when evaluating overall project risk. First, your ability to deliver the project with the risks you know about, and then controlling the various directions the project can take to reach a conclusion. Let‚Äôs take a look at each of these. Risks, should they come to pass, will have an impact on your project outcomes, along with the money and time it takes to deliver those outcomes. If the impacts of your risks or the cost to address those risks outweigh the benefits you‚Äôll get from the project, you probably shouldn‚Äôt proceed. For example, if you work in an insurance company developing new products, you need to watch insurance regulations to be sure you can legally sell the products you design. Let‚Äôs say the government starts discussing new regulations and your experts determine there‚Äôs a 70% chance a law change will make your new insurance offering illegal to sell. You might want to reconsider your project as being too high risk until you know more about the regulations that are put into law. This was a very high risk example. It isn‚Äôt always that obvious. So, the viability of your project should be examined frequently. As your individual risks change, so will your overall project risk. This should be reviewed with your sponsor on a regular basis. Then, your ability to control the various directions your project takes is the other major factor to consider when addressing overall project risk. As your project unfolds, unexpected discoveries may surface. So, let‚Äôs say the technical approach planned for your project turns out to have more variables than you expected. I had this happen on an IT project I managed. After starting the project, my company bought another small company as a means of expanding their product offerings. This new scope created many complications. What started as a straightforward technical solution was going to have to interact with three other systems. So I had a larger number of variables to consider. I could no longer reliably predict what course of action was best to deliver the project. This introduced significant risk, and we canceled the project to allow us to study our options and launch a new project. Other examples of overall project risk are in the exercise files for the course. Overall risk is the key to determine if a project is appropriate. Surfacing concerns with overall risk isn‚Äôt a failure on your part. Rather, it‚Äôs the smart thing to do to protect your organization. Though many might see big healthy trees around you, making sure you‚Äôre in the right forest is one of your jobs as a project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-agile-risk-management&quot;&gt;4. Agile risk management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever have the feeling you‚Äôve experienced something before like your life history is repeating itself? When you‚Äôre managing risk on an agile project, that‚Äôs the case and it‚Äôs absolutely fantastic. The iterative nature of an agile project is ideal for risk management if you have the right mindset. Here are my recommendations for performing risk management in an agile environment. First, understand that by design risks will change more rapidly in an agile environment. At the end of every sprint you may add, delete, or reprioritize features. This flexibility in providing functionality for the client is great, but it also changes the risk profile for your upcoming sprint and potentially the entire project. For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre working on a project to create an executive dashboard for your company. The dashboard will provide your senior management team with critical information about financial status, competitors‚Äô performance, and sales projections. Each feature that is produced could surface risks such as ensuring that data retrieved for the dashboard is up-to-date, information is from the same timeframe when combined with other datasets, ensuring search capabilities for the executives will yield the intended report. As the executives use each feature and ask for new capabilities, the chances of these risks increasing or other risks surfacing is very high. Diligence in managing these rapidly changing risks is critical. The second characteristic is fortunately that risks can be revisited naturally due to the agile life cycle. Given the dashboard project that I‚Äôve just shared with you, at the end of each sprint the backlog of features will be reviewed and reprioritized. This is a very convenient and appropriate time to revisit risk. New features, the sequence used to produce features, and reviewing the results of features already produced are a great source of potential risk going forward. Taking time at the end of each sprint to review risk should be part of the habits your agile team uses to manage your project. Third, risks can be assessed frequently. As agile sprints are typically only a few weeks long, reviewing risks at the end of each sprint creates a risk management culture within the project. In our project example, the project team and executives that are using the dashboard can discuss risks while the information is fresh. So the concept of risk management is kept front of mind while progressing the project. Leveraging the agile life cycle to control your risk is one of the greatest benefits agile brings to project management. Take full advantage of this, as it‚Äôs a prudent way to ensure risks are known and addressed during your project. I guess it‚Äôs one of those instances where history repeating itself is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Common risk responses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project managers are like Superman or Wonder Woman with bullets coming at them. The bullets are risks and you want to plan risk responses to the incoming bullets. You could step out of the way, avoiding the risks. You could use a shield to deflect the bullets or mitigate the risk. You could pick up a bad guy and put him in the way of the bullets transferring the risk. Or, having super powers, you could accept the risk of being hit by the bullets if they won‚Äôt harm you. While we aren‚Äôt actually superheroes, we do have the same variety of risk responses. Let‚Äôs take a close look. Avoiding a risk means we eliminate it. Whatever risk might be present, we take action to make it irrelevant. Let‚Äôs say your project involves something out of fiberglass, however, a risk exists that the fiberglass might be too flexible so instead, you and the team decide to make the component out of steel. You avoided the risk by using steel. Another response, is to mitigate the risk. You do so by reducing the probability or reducing the impact of a risk occurring. Let‚Äôs look at reducing the probability of a risk occurring first. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre concerned that the vendor you‚Äôre working with might be late in delivering their products to you. One approach, reducing the probability of lateness being an impact is to put a contingency contract in place with a second vendor. You could call upon them if the primary vendor will be late. The second approach, is to reduce the impact of a risk occurring. You could create an alternate project schedule to perform tasks later than involve the parts you‚Äôre receiving from the vendor. You can also respond with transference. In transference, you shift the risk to someone else. The most common example of this is taking out insurance. When you get insurance on your car, much of the risk impact is transferred to the insurance company. You can also accept the risk. This means you do nothing to avoid the risk. It‚Äôs a common response for low priority risk events. Lastly, you can escalate the risk. You do this when risk is beyond the project manager‚Äôs scope. For example, a change in strategy for the company, isn‚Äôt a risk that the property manager would normally be involved in. The responses for positive risks or opportunities are similar. Excepting and escalating have the same meaning. Instead of avoiding the risk, we strive to exploit it. Increase the possibility of it occurring to 100% when possible. Share, replace as transfer, you involve another party to increase the positive effects or probability of the opportunity occurring. Finally, enhance replaces mitigate where we increase the probability or impact of the positive risk occurring. As you can see, you have great options for response approaches to address your risk. Even if you aren‚Äôt a superhero. Think through them and you‚Äôll easily clean-up your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-write-your-risk-plan&quot;&gt;2. Write your risk plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a problem. I love building risk plans, but sometimes I forget I have those plans when I get into the day to day excitement of project execution. So, how do I ensure the risk activities I plan for are executed when I need them? The answer is create a risk response plan, a document that captures your risks, the analysis you‚Äôve performed, and guides your actions going forward. Let‚Äôs talk about what to include in your risk response plan. First, the risk response plans lists your risks, including identified risk causes, descriptions, and potential impacts. Second, include your qualitative and quantitative analysis results and your response plan for each risk. You may include a primary and secondary risk response plan if appropriate. Third, include contingency reserve funds that have been allocated. If you have risks that include contract-related actions you‚Äôll discuss with your vendors, note these as well. After these fundamentals are in your risk response plan, these additional elements can turn a risk response plan into a powerful control document. The most significant item to add to each risk is the timing for when you need to either A, assess the status of the risk, or B, execute a response action. These can be added as tasks in your project schedule and assigned to a specific individual. Here‚Äôs an example. When I was moving from the US to a work assignment in Australia and having my household goods sent to Australia by sea, I didn‚Äôt know when I packed the container, whether it would go from LA to Sydney directly or via Singapore. Therefore, when I arrived in Australia, I didn‚Äôt know if I needed to get a short-term furnished apartment or arrange for a permanent place to live where I would have my furniture delivered. I had a housing risk to manage. I had to know two timing-critical actions against that risk. When to check the schedule status of my shipment to determine if my furniture would be available and when I needed to find a temporary furnished apartment if needed. The next significant item to have in your risk response plan are status dates for your vendors, or to check on products from areas not under your control. Going back to my furniture shipment, I had another risk to manage. The customs agent in Australia could decide to inspect my goods shipment or hold it in quarantine for a period of time. I had to monitor the progress of my household goods through Australia customs. I had no control over them and had to establish dates when I needed to get temporary housing, even though my furniture might be in the country with me. By ensuring your plan is robust and helps you track the actions required to monitor and execute responses against risks, you can dramatically reduce the impact of risk on your project and not experience things like getting stuck with a house but no furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-understand-risk-triggers&quot;&gt;3. Understand risk triggers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good project risk managers resemble park rangers. Park rangers construct towers to keep an eye on the landscape, looking for signs of trouble. This works well because where there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs usually fire. You should do the same thing. As smoke is the warning sign for fire, I suggest you spend time thinking of what are called risk triggers, early warning signs like smoke that indicate a project risk is about to become a reality. Let‚Äôs look at two common types of risk trigger. The first type of risk trigger is one that gives you an immediate indication that a risk may be happening. You may have technical experts that are going to join your project at some point downstream. You request these technical experts to start attending status meetings one month before they‚Äôre due to start so they can hit the ground running and know what‚Äôs happening on the project. The time for them to participate has arrived, you remind them of their commitment, and they don‚Äôt show up for the status meeting. This is a likely risk trigger that other priorities might put the expert‚Äôs participation in your project at risk. The second type of risk trigger are forward indicators. Unlike smoke, which indicates the fire is happening now, forward indicator risk triggers are signals something is going to happen in the future. Tuna fishermen provide a useful example of a forward indicator risk trigger because they have risk triggers tied to the temperature of the water at different times of the year. They understand if it‚Äôs going to be plentiful fishing season or if there‚Äôs a risk of poor fishing depending on the water temperature. Project risk triggers can vary and typically involve people‚Äôs behavior, unexpected schedule changes, or task deadline failures. No matter the type or variety, here are hints for determining and handling risk triggers. I‚Äôve provided a short checklist of potential risk triggers in the exercise files. First, do some research. Potential sources for risk triggers include prior risk logs, post-implementation reviews, and issues logs from past projects. Second, once you‚Äôve determined reasonable risk triggers, empower your team to search for them. The reality is that while you have to keep your eye on things, you can‚Äôt be everywhere. Empower your project team so they understand the risk triggers too. Get them to staff the watchtowers and look for smoke. Third, plan what you‚Äôre going to do when you spot a risk trigger. The whole idea of utilizing risk triggers is to enable you to react quickly and decisively. Have a risk response plan for when you spot that smoke. Just like your doctor uses a series of tests to assess your health, risk triggers help you validate the health of your project. So, just like the park rangers, watch diligently, understand what you‚Äôre looking for, and react promptly and you‚Äôll have a healthy project without large fires.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these risks, it‚Äôs just too much. They‚Äôre making me crazy. How could you manage a project without spending 120% of your time managing risk? The answer is perform a qualitative risk analysis to prioritize your risks. To do so, perform a quick high-level assessment of their probability and impact. Here‚Äôs my approach. First, assess the impact of each risk. Determine if each risk would have a high, medium, or low project impact. The impacts you consider should include cost, schedule, and deliverable quality. Second, do the same for probability, high, medium, or low. Keep it simple. The point is to get a quick high-level ranking for all your risks. It‚Äôs a filter to help you work out which risks are worth spending your time on. Now, the next step, sort the results. This will give you a high-level reference for which risks need to be examined further. You‚Äôll want to address your high probability, high-impact risks first, then look at your risks rated with lower probabilities and impacts. For all of your risks with low ratings, you‚Äôre probably not going to examine them much further, and that‚Äôs okay. After you‚Äôve performed a qualitative analysis and identified the risks you should consider managing, then you conduct a quantitative risk analysis on your top-ranked risks. Quantitative analysis is the process that informs you how much you could spend to address a risk. For example, you don‚Äôt want to spend $10,000 to address a risk that will cost you $5,000 if the risk event occurs. Here are my steps for quantitative analysis. First, refine the probability for each risk occurring. Because we‚Äôre looking for a more refined estimate, assign a probability in increments of 10. So, 10%, 20%, and so forth. Second, estimate the cost of your project if a risk occurs. This could be hard to estimate, but give it a try. The third step is to multiply your estimates for the probability and cost impact for each risk and sort the result. This will highlight your most important risks. For example, Risk A has a probability of occurring of 70%, and an impact of $10,000. The resulting answer would be 70% of 10,000 or $7,000. If Risk B had a probability of 30% and a cost impact of $150,000 the result would be 30% of $150,000 or $45,000 so Risk B should be addressed before Risk A. The last step is to take your most important risks and ask, if I was going to address this risk, how much would this cost? There could be a number of ways to address a risk. However, the greater the potential impact, the more analysis you‚Äôll want to perform. So that‚Äôs it. Understanding which risks you need to manage and determining how much you can spend to address them is vital for proper project risk management. The key is to be methodical. Categorize and address your most vital risks and save yourself from the risk of going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-variability-and-ambiguity-risks&quot;&gt;2. Variability and ambiguity risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what you need to know can be stressful. Not even knowing what you don‚Äôt know can be distressing. Let‚Äôs look at two categories of project risk that involve things you don‚Äôt fully know. These risks can create problems if they‚Äôre not considered. The first is variability risk. This is risk that comes from variables in your environment that always exist, but over which you have no control. For example, weather can have a significant impact on the schedule of a construction project. While you might target a time of year when the weather‚Äôs more cooperative, weather will always vary. The second category is ambiguity risk. In contrast with variability risks where you know something will happen but the results will vary, like the weather, ambiguity risks deal with unknown factors about what will happen in the future. Examples of this are legislation that may be signed into law during the course of your project that require changes, new technical inventions that may improve or detract from your project, or a new product that may be introduced by a competitor that exceeds your deliverable‚Äôs capabilities. To help you identify these two risk types, I‚Äôve included a checklist with examples in the exercise file for this course. These two risk types are especially difficult as they have characteristics that are unknown. So how do you deal with them? Let‚Äôs return to our variability risks. Timeframes or circumstances where the variability is less is the first place to look, so for example scheduling construction during periods when the weather is more favorable would demonstrate this approach. Here‚Äôs another approach. If you have access to records from several past projects similar to the project you‚Äôre running, you can compile a list of schedule possibilities for completing the project based on that history and plan your project around the information you uncover. If that project history is not available or you need more detailed schedule predictions, you can use Monte Carlo analysis. Monte Carlo analysis uses probability spreads compiled from running large numbers of possibilities through a math-based model to determine the range of possibilities for your project schedule. This can inform you about the chances of your schedule completing in varying amounts of time to help you manage schedule risk. Ambiguity risks are typically addressed by collecting expert opinions. For example, people who are close to the workings of government can help predict where and when laws might change. Industry experts would likely signal an upcoming new development like the moving downloading services that ultimately spelled the end for brick and mortar DVD rental stores. While you can never know every risk that may surface for your project, having a standard process for considering the possibilities is important so you don‚Äôt get stung. Spending time looking at the potential impacts of variability and ambiguity risks can save you time, help you be ready for the unexpected, and increase your perception as a project leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-assess-and-prioritize-analyzed-risks&quot;&gt;3. Assess and prioritize analyzed risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate spiders but I think snakes are pretty cool. My wife however, is terrified by both of them. Eliminating either of these critters in my yard is a high priority for her. However, I‚Äôd rather leave the snakes and get rid of the spiders. Our priority for risks is different. A similar situation will take place on your projects. It‚Äôs important to remember that your stakeholders, sponsors, and project team may want you to treat risks differently. Here are the steps you can take to make sure you and your risk sensitive stakeholders will be aligned when it comes to managing your project risks. First, split your risks into impact type. Time impacts, scope impacts, and cost impacts. Once you‚Äôve done this, consider your stakeholders‚Äô tolerance for these three types of risk. Second, consider prioritizing your risks to ensure the impact type with the lowest stakeholder tolerance gets a high priority. By understanding the sensitivities of your stakeholders and sponsor and adjusting the way you prioritize things, you‚Äôll have an easier time managing risk on your project. The third step in refining your risk analysis is to consider your potential risk treatment actions and their cost. Then compare the actual cost the risk would add to your project and most importantly the impact to the perception of your stakeholders. A project manager and sponsor rarely have a large fund to mitigate risks. As a result, you need to decide how to allocate those funds wisely. If you only have $200,000 of risk treatment funding available to manage risk on your project, you want to have the risk prioritized and only allocate the $200,000 to the risks that should be addressed. This prioritization should consider the overall financial impact to the risk, the cost of addressing the risk, and the risk tolerance of your sponsor and senior stakeholders. Once you‚Äôve done this, you‚Äôre ready to take the fourth and final step to completing your risk analysis. Share your prioritized risks with your sponsor. I have included a table in the exercise files to provide you with a format I recommend. Here are some tips to finalize your risk analysis. It‚Äôs important that you communicate your estimates and assumptions so you and your stakeholders understand your thought process. And last, fault on the side of being inclusive, involve as many stakeholders as you can. Not only will you produce a better risk analysis product but in the event an unexpected risk does become an issue, you won‚Äôt be alone when answering the dreaded why didn‚Äôt you think of that question? Taking these steps to assess and prioritize risks is well worth it. Understanding who will react to each type of risk can help you understand and proactively work with your stakeholders. Kind of like understanding that your boss might be terrified of that snake. So even though you think it‚Äôs cool with beautiful markings, best keep it away from him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Risk identification methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward on a project without performing risk identification is like heading on a hike in the wilderness without a GPS. It‚Äôs easy to get yourself quite lost when you encounter the unexpected and don‚Äôt have anything to help you navigate. Risks represent the unexpected in my hiking analogy. Different types of projects have different risks and if you don‚Äôt know your risks, the probability of them occurring and the impact they‚Äôll have, it‚Äôs impossible to manage them. So an appropriate risk identification process is crucial. Here are risk identification approaches I recommend for use with your projects. The first approach is to hold a brainstorming session, also called a risk workshop. As they say, several heads are better than one, and this holds true when identifying project risks. For these workshops however, don‚Äôt limit yourself to your project team. It‚Äôs a good idea to involve your stakeholders, sponsor, and potentially other project managers in this workshop. To make these sessions more effective, it‚Äôs important that you use a list of questions, also called a prompt list. For example, is your customer organization used to change? Are there external factors that will impact your project? Does a lack of a particular skill in the organization present a risk? What are the lessons learned from previous projects? In the this session, have everyone come up with their top five risks, and remember that through this exercise, traditional brainstorming rules apply. Capture all the potential risks. There are no bad ideas. You‚Äôll sort through them later. If you need some ideas for your prompt list, I‚Äôve provided sample questions that you can download in the Exercise Files for this course. Examples include, what would be most likely to become more expensive to produce than what we expect, and why? Which of our project team members is mostly likely to have another priority item assigned to him? What would the impact be? The second risk identification method I recommend is to use industry-specific risk categories. For example, in the construction industry, there are safety risks. In IT, there are information security risks and risk involving making solutions too complex. To help, most industry associations have online resources and risk tools that you can leverage. Use them to identify risks if you‚Äôre a member of an association that makes risk resources available. You might also find resources through other project managers involved in your industry. The Project Management Institute also has project management standards for projects in government, software, and construction. The last technique to consider for risk identification is to examine your work breakdown structure, or WBS, and identify risk by task or groups of tasks. Using the tasks in the WBS can trigger risk ideas that you otherwise might miss. This is a good last step to help ensure you‚Äôve thoroughly considered risks that may impact your project. You can‚Äôt address risks you haven‚Äôt identified. Launching your risk management approach with thorough and well-considered risk identification practices will help you avoid being lost in the project wilderness without a GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-categorizing-and-consolidating-risks&quot;&gt;2. Categorizing and consolidating risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks are like having a large cart of groceries. You need to sort things out, place items in separate bags for the freezer, fridge and pantry so you‚Äôre organized when you get home. The same pertains to risks on your project. How will you ensure your risks are well-organized so you can manage them? Categorizing risks for your project is a great way to ensure you‚Äôre well-organized. Let me share some typical ways to categorize risks and some tips for using those categories wisely. First, try to identify any risks that have common causes. For example, one common area for risks might be not having enough people, or you lack people with the relevant skills. You could have a substantial list of risks, but many can be managed collectively by tying them back to a category of people and skills. A second way to categorize risk is by business area, such as external market risks or business strategy changes. This can be very helpful when you‚Äôre dealing with your client and the risks they bring to the project. Taking this approach can enhance the perception that you‚Äôre managing the project with your client and their needs in mind. It can also help engage your client to ensure you manage their risks appropriately. A third way to categorize risks is by technical area. These might include design and development challenges, testing and maintenance risks and uncertainty with technical vendors. Fourth, you can utilize an integration risk category. Integration risks surface when you‚Äôre working on your project while there are other things happening in your organization. This activity can cause priority problems or conflicts with other project deliverables. If you have nine projects targeting a single business area, this might signal a need to address integration risks, as solutions may need to be coordinated or even merged together. Although these are common risk categories, you may find other categories that are more useful on the specific projects you manage. No matter which categories you use, here are a few tips for using those categories to manage risks. Revise your categories as necessary. As the project progresses, you may learn more about the risks that are substantial. Therefore, more relevant categories may surface. My final tip is to always keep your list of categories short and simple. Try to avoid a heap of categories for you and your team to sort out. Package the risks so they‚Äôre relevant for your project team and other stakeholders. For help with this, I‚Äôve included a risk identification checklist in the exercise files for the course to give you an example. Using well-crafted risk categories can help you manage your project risks more easily. But it also helps your stakeholders see the risks for what they are, and helps you work with your risks more effectively, kind of like ensuring you don‚Äôt leave frozen items on your kitchen counter when you get home from the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-risk-records-and-registers&quot;&gt;3. Risk records and registers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk management plans fill up lots of waste baskets, accompanied by frustrated project managers screaming things like, ‚ÄúThis risk plan is useless.‚Äù The difference between risk plans that work and those that do not usually comes down to one simple element: the way risks are written. Let me share a story where risk records were written inadequately. An airport identifies a risk that their fuel trucks may be unable to make it to refuel airplanes in a timely manner. This‚Äôll cause flight delays. As a response, the project manager assumes the risk involves the fuel trucks having a mechanical failure. He decides to have more fuel trucks available so they‚Äôll always have a truck ready to refuel the aircraft. Sounds like a reasonable risk mitigation strategy. However, during the next month the fuel truck drivers go on strike. They could have all the fuel trucks in the world, and none of them would show up. What went wrong here? The project team only considered one cause for the risk occurring. So you don‚Äôt end up like our unfortunate airport manager, let‚Äôs take a look at the formula for writing effective risk records. A properly structured risk record is as easy as pie. The probability of impact as the result of an event. Add the cause of the event and you have a useful risk record. Back to our airport example. An appropriate risk record would be there is an x% chance that the fuel truck drivers will go on strike, causing the fuel trucks and aircraft departures to be delayed. This will increase costs by $y per flight. It‚Äôs notable here that you may need more than one risk record to cover other items, flat tires, for instance, that may delay fuel truck arrivals. This could be covered with additional trucks. Doing good risk identification and analysis is important, but it all has to go somewhere. That place would be your risk register. First, your risk register captures the risks that have been identified in an overall assessment of project risk. Your project level risk comes from looking at your risk overall, and total potential impact to your project. Many high-impact risks that would be expensive to avoid would lead to a high risk project. Few risks overall or few risks that have high cost response plans likely means your project is low risk. Between these two end points you probably have a medium risk project. Second, include your plans for treating each risk, as well as the cost of any treatment strategy. You might do this for medium and high risks only. Third, identify the owner of each risk and how the risk is tied to tasks in your project schedule. Finally, keep it current. Make sure the risk register is updated after every status meeting. Follow these activities and it will bring your risk management to life and keep your project healthy. Oh, and it‚Äôll also reduce your need to empty your waste basket.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Understanding risks and opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects deal with change, and dealing with change is risky business, as many businesses don‚Äôt handle change very well. My experience is that many project managers aren‚Äôt prepared so they don‚Äôt appropriately manage risk. When I talk about risk, I‚Äôm talking about things that haven‚Äôt happened yet. There‚Äôs a probability of some sort of event occurring that‚Äôll have an impact on your project. There are two major categories for risk, positive and negative risk. Positive risks are often called opportunities. These are things that can happen that will enhance the outcome of your project. For example, your project team might make a breakthrough that cuts the time to complete a set of tasks in half the time. As there are typically more instances of negative things happening in projects that have to be managed, project managers typically focus on negative risk. Negative risks are events that could cause your project to be thrown off course, so it‚Äôs vital that you pay attention to them. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with positive or negative risk, there are a standard series of steps to follow when managing risk. First, you need to identify the risks on your project. When you see something that will probably happen, you should take action ahead of time, before the impacts affect your project. Be proactive rather than being reactive. The second step is to assess the likelihood of a risk happening and determine which risks you will address. You don‚Äôt address all risks, as some, like an asteroid destroying your building, is so unlikely you won‚Äôt want to deal with it via risk management. Addressing risks means taking action. Determining the actions to take is step three. This is to investigate alternatives to address your risks. You‚Äôll want to steer your project around the bumpy section of the road, or you might try to smooth out part of the road for a more comfortable ride. Using either alternative, the idea for you as a project manager is to control how much your projects are exposed to risk. The last step in the risk management process is to control risks on an ongoing basis. This is important to do because risks change over time. You should frequently assess your project for the likelihood of a risk happening and its potential impact. Understanding the consequences of any risk will help you manage it appropriately. Any sort of change comes with a level of risk. It‚Äôs how you manage that risk that makes all the difference. Ultimately, project management is risk management. By clearly understanding your risks in light of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve, your project has a greater chance of being delivered successfully, and you might not be perceived as a risk taker for working on your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-incorporating-risk-management&quot;&gt;2. Incorporating risk management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt try this at home. We hear this a lot on action or experiment based TV programs. Why? Because the risks of harm are great. The average person should never try the skateboard tricks you see on TV. Projects, while not typically physically dangerous, should come with a warning like those TV programs. They come with risk. As a project manager, not a day goes by when I don‚Äôt see something that could present a risk to my project. My advice to you? Deal with risk thoroughly without it consuming every moment of your day. Here are a few survival tips to help you do this. First, use risk to prioritize what you do on a day-to-day basis. At the start of every day, prioritize your tasks. Seek to tackle the riskiest things first. For example, if you think that one of your vendors might miss a deadline, you should prioritize your time to visit with them to understand and examine your options if necessary. If you think a risk is going to impact an implementation process, look at that process, assess it, and attempt to control it. Better yet, change the process to reduce the risk. Second, discuss risk openly with your sponsor. Ask what risks they think are important and determine what they think of your strategies to deal with risks. Ask for suggestions and garner their support. Third, make risks a regular topic at your status meetings. You should include your customers and your sponsor in these discussions. Having regular, open, and frank discussions about risk will help you manage risk as a regular course of doing business. Finally, after each of these risk assessment discussions, create or update your overall risk plan. This plan details the risks you are managing and provides an ongoing means of reporting what actions you‚Äôre taking and the status of each risk. Your vendor potentially being late would be added to your plan, if you didn‚Äôt have one in there already. The risk plan helps you ensure you‚Äôre on top of what‚Äôs going on with risk on your project. Working the plan proactively helps you be cool, calm, and collected in your risk management approach. I like to treat risk management as an everyday event and an essential part of keeping my projects on track. If you ignore the whole idea of risk management, you‚Äôll end up fighting fires and this is a tough way to spend your day. Fighting fires can have a negative impact on your schedule, your costs, and the quality of the products you deliver. Not to mention the emotional drain it puts on your and your team. And you‚Äôll be so busy putting out the fires that any process improvement opportunities will be largely overlooked. If you look and act like you‚Äôre in control of risk, then you‚Äôll have a better chance of getting other engaged in a sensible risk management approach. In addition, you‚Äôll help your management perceive you as a person with a balanced business approach to implementing your project and not engaging on those crazy skateboard stunts you‚Äôd only see on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-stakeholders-risk-tolerance&quot;&gt;3. Stakeholder‚Äôs risk tolerance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World renowned boxer Muhammad Ali said, ‚ÄúHe who is not courageous enough to take risks ‚Äúwill accomplish nothing in life.‚Äù Now, his idea of risk, however, may be different than yours and mine. After all, he used to step into the boxing ring with someone trying to knock his head off. Most project managers don‚Äôt want anything to do with being in a boxing ring, but they‚Äôre happy to tolerate other risks. So, how do you find out about your stakeholder‚Äôs risk tolerance? First, be prepared that your stakeholders, sponsors, and the people on your project team will each tolerate risk differently. Some people might actually step into that boxing ring while others are cautious just walking down stairs. And there‚Äôs everyone in between. You need to take this into consideration when you talk about risk in your project. The key is to always listen carefully as you discuss elements of your project. The second thing to keep in mind is that people have business motivations to protect scope, time, or money when these constraints are discussed. We need to understand these motivations. For example, one organization I know of is involved in yearly industry trade shows. At these shows the company is expected to display new products. If they don‚Äôt have new products ready to show off at the trade shows, it‚Äôll impact their business. A project stakeholder in this instance will be totally focused on time constraints because it‚Äôs critical they have products ready to demonstrate at that trade show. Risk impacts to cost and scope are a much lower priority for them as long as they get their new product when required. A third factor when considering risk tendency is your stakeholder‚Äôs performance evaluation. How is your stakeholder being appraised by their manager? What are they being encouraged to do or change in their business area? Candid discussions about your stakeholder‚Äôs expectations and concerns can give you a feel for which project constraints they‚Äôll want to focus on. To obtain this information, it‚Äôs necessary to pose critical questions, and listen very carefully to the answers you receive. Without directly asking about their personal performance evaluation you can ask them what business outcomes are they most excited about, and what potential negative business outcomes most concern you? What are you being incented to achieve this year? Fourth, is the culture of the organization. It has a substantial impact on risk tolerance. Some entrepreneurial organizations will take significant risk, whereas more conservative industries will more aggressively seek to mitigate risk. And as their project manager, they‚Äôll expect you to conform to their style. Muhammad Ali used to say, ‚ÄúI float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.‚Äù Appreciate the risk tolerance of your stakeholders, and you might not float like a butterfly, but you won‚Äôt be accused of stinging like a bee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murphy‚Äôs Law states if anything can go wrong, it will. Well, I believe Murphy has relatives, and they all live in project circles. Doesn‚Äôt take much for risk to haunt your project. So, to control this potential chaos, you build a risk plan. A risk plan is a document that describes how project risk management will be structured and performed on a project. I‚Äôve included a sample plan in the exercise files, and shortly, I will talk you through an example based on that plan structure. First, your risk plan needs to describe your risk identification approach. The most common way to do this is to run a risk identification workshop. Get a group together, including sponsors and project team members, and brainstorm risks. You could use risk registers from prior projects as a start. The second element of a risk plan is to capture how you‚Äôll describe the risks. For example, you‚Äôll want to capture the characteristics of the risks. Characteristics include categories like personnel or technical issues. You might also capture the nature of impact to the project should the risk occur. Schedule, cost, and scope are common impact descriptions. The third element of your risk plan is to document how you will perform qualitative and quantitative risk analysis. Qualitative analysis is when you prioritize risks based on their probability and impact of occurring. Quantitative analysis is when you estimate their effects on project objectives. Here‚Äôs an example of a qualitative analysis. The risk is, will a power outage impact the installation of your deliverables. If so, what impact would this have on your project? What‚Äôs the likelihood of it occurring? To do this efficiently, I suggest you use high, medium, and low to answer each of those questions. You don‚Äôt need to get overly detailed at this point. After this qualitative analysis, you take a further look at your significant risks via a quantitative analysis. You try to quantify the impact. By doing the quantitative analysis you can assess how much you could spend to try and reduce the risk. Using our power outage example, you don‚Äôt want to use $10,000 to buy a power generator to prevent the power outage risk that will cost $5,000 if it occurs. The fourth element of a risk plan is the approach you‚Äôll take to address each significant risk. For example, will you purchase the power generator to avoid a total power outage, or will you schedule alternate installation times in the event of a power disruption. The last element of your risk management plan is how you will monitor and update risks as your project progresses. This section describes things like regular risk assessment meetings to keep on top of changing risks. It also describes how you‚Äôll update and communicate new risk status items on your project. Using these elements to create and manage your risk plan will put you on solid ground to handle risks, and uninvite all the Murphys from your project party.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="project_management" /><category term="risk" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.

Interpretability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve done all the work. You‚Äôve planned the project. You‚Äôve found data. You cleaned and organized the data. You created a model, you validated the model and you just want to put a bow on it and be done. Well, one thing that you need to consider before you wrap it all up, is who is going to make the decision? Who‚Äôs using the results and the insights that you got from your analysis? Because you have a couple of choices. One is, maybe you‚Äôre developing something that is for the benefit and use of algorithms. This is, for instance, a recommendation system which automatically puts something in front of people or a mortgage application system, which process it immediately while people are still on the website. In that case, the machines are the ones making the decisions and machines don‚Äôt need to understand what they‚Äôre working with. They have the data and if you set up the algorithm properly, they can just kind of run with it. Also, machines and algorithms can create complex models much more complex than a human can easily understand and implement them directly and immediately. And so if you‚Äôve done your analysis in such a way there is going to be finished working with by an algorithm, then you don‚Äôt need to worry too much about how interpretable it is, because the machines not spending time on that. On the other hand, if you have done your work for the benefit of humans, humans need to understand the principles involved. They need to know why things are happening the way that they are. So, they can then take that information, they can reason from the data, to apply it to new situations. It‚Äôs the principles that are going to be important and so you‚Äôre going to have to be able to explain that to them as a result of your work in Data Science. Now, the trick is, some results are easy to interpret. Here‚Äôs a decision tree I showed you earlier. It‚Äôs about classifying flowers as one of the three different species. You only have to make three decisions. It says, first look at the pedal length and if it‚Äôs long, then look at the pedal width and if that is short, then look at the pedal length again and if you do that, you can make a very good classification. This is a very simple system and human accessible, anybody can work with this. On the other hand, some other results are very difficult to interpret. This is another decision tree that I showed you earlier. It‚Äôs enormously complicated by regular human standards, you‚Äôd have kind of a hard time following through with this. And algorithms that are made in Data Science, like with Deep Learning, are infinitely more complex than this. And so you‚Äôre going to have a hard time explaining to somebody else, how this works and why it set up the way it is and what they can do with it. The point of all this, is it in your analysis, interpretability is critical. You‚Äôre telling a story and you need to be able to make sense of your findings, so you can make reasonable and justifiable recommendations. Tell a story that makes sense, is clear and compelling. Only then, can you see the value from your Data Science project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-actionable-insights&quot;&gt;2. Actionable insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre working in a startup or really any entrepreneurial or organizational setting then you know that your work is all about getting results and that brings up something that I mentioned earlier in this course I want to mention again from one of my heroes, the American psychologist and philosopher William James who said ‚Äúmy thinking is first and last ‚Äúand always for the sake of my doing.‚Äù His point is that human cognition is designed to fulfill goals, to help us reach particular ends and I like to summarize that and apply it towards data science with this thought that data and data science is for doing. It exists to help us do things and the reason we do these projects is to help us accomplish things that are important to us. Remember, when you did the project, there was a goal, there was some motivation. What motivated the project? What sorts of things did you stick up on the wall? These are questions you wanted answered. Why was the project conducted? The goal is usually to direct some kind of particular action. Should we open a new store over here? Should we reduce the price over here? Should we partner up with this other organization over here and your analysis should be able to guide those actions and so can you remember what those clear questions were and can you give a clear well articulated and justifiable response to those questions based on your data science project? When you do, there‚Äôs a few things you want to keep in mind. You need to focus on things that are controllable. The analysis might say that companies founded in the 80s have greater success but if you‚Äôre founded in 2015, there‚Äôs not much you can do about it. So focus on something that is under your control and try to make it something that‚Äôs specific. Also, be practical. Think about the return on investment or ROI. You need to work on things and give actions where the impact will be large enough to justify the efforts. Also, if you‚Äôre giving recommendations to a client, make sure it‚Äôs something that they are actually capable of doing and then also you want to build up. You want to have sequential steps. You want to make a small recommendation, carry through on it and then build on it as you see the results of each earlier step. The data science project is designed to fulfill all of these requirements in a way that the benefits will be visible to the client as you help them find an answer to their question and if you can get that done then you‚Äôve done exactly what you meant to do when you started in data science and that is worthy of an office celebration so congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider learning new things, like, for instance, how to program in Python or R, or how to work with open data, or how to build algorithms for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Any of these would be fantastically useful tools and approaches in data science. Also, learn how to apply the things that you‚Äôve worked with. Get some courses on data-driven decision making in business settings, get more information on business strategy and how the information you use can help any organization make better decisions in their own operations. And then get information on how people work, and the elements that are most important in fields like marketing or nonprofits or healthcare or education, or whatever is of greatest use and interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Learning Archive</name></author><category term="technology" /><category term="data_science" /><category term="learning_archive" /><summary type="html">1.
