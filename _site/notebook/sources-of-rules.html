<p>Let’s say you meet someone at a party and after talking for awhile you start to wonder if that person might be interested in you. This is apparently a question that is on a lot of people’s minds. If Google’s auto-complete is to be trusted, assessing attraction is a major research question. Of the top 10 statements to start how to tell, the first two are on this topic. Shortly followed by how to tell an egg is bad and in fact, men appear to be sufficiently difficult to read that they get to appear twice on the top 10 list. And so that let’s you know we need an answer to this question, how can you tell if somebody is interested in you? Well maybe we can propose some rules. Maybe they’re interested in you because they said so. Or maybe they smiled and made eye contact. Or maybe they just swiped right. And again, there are the insecure doubts that pop up and undermine your belief in these things. Maybe it’s wonderful to meet you isn’t diagnostic and they say that to everybody. Maybe they smile when they’re bored or maybe they slipped on the ice and fell and accidentally swiped the wrong way. All these things that can undermine your faith in the rules that you have. But lest you think I’m just being silly in these examples, I want to point out that this is a legitimate data science problem. Dating apps are a multi-billion dollar business. And if you can help people find someone they love, then you have truly accomplished something worthwhile too. So, if we want to write a program to help people figure out if someone likes them, maybe we just need to include a little more detail and create a flowchart with explicit rules and qualifications before concluding with a definitive yes or no. This is an example of what’s called an expert system. An expert system is an approach to machine decision-making in which algorithms are designed that mimic the decision-making process of a human domain expert. In this case, maybe Jane Austen. She was an incisive and strategic decision-maker and when it came to matters of the heart. For example, here’s a set of observations from “Pride and Prejudice” where we’re pointed out that being wholly engrossed by one person and inattentive to others, offending people by not asking them to dance, having people speak to you and not answering, she says, “Could there be finer symptoms?” Could there be more diagnostic criteria for amorous inclinations? She says, “Is not general incivility “the very essence of love?” And so maybe we could create an expert system based on these criteria. Now, I can imagine a lot of situations where this might not work well but there are many other situations in which expert systems which model the decision-making of an expert have worked remarkably well. Those include things like flowcharts to help you determine which data analysis method is most appropriate for answering the question you have given the data that’s available to you. Or criteria for medical diagnoses. I’m in psychology and so we use the DSM which has the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association to say if a person has these symptoms but not these, than this is the likely diagnoses. Or even business strategies where you can give general checklists of approaches on what to do first, what to do next and how to reach the goals that you have. But it’s important to remember that like any system, logic and the flow of expert based decisions has its limits. You’re eventually going to hit the wall. You’re going to meet situations that you just can’t accurately predict or they’ll be things that you never anticipated and so it turns out that there are significant limits to enumerating explicit rules for decision-making and in fact we need more flexible and more powerful methods which is what I’m going to turn to next.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-derivation-of-rules-from-data-analysis">2. The derivation of rules from data analysis</h2>

<p>A dancer has to spend years working on their craft to deliver a masterful performance. One of the paradoxes of this training is that sometimes you have to think a little bit less in order to move better. Your conscious processes can interfere with fluid and meaningful movement. Sometimes you just have to calm down all your ideas about expert decision-making systems and the rules that they bring along, and let the data have a say in how you should go about your work. We’ll start by looking at linear regression, which is a common and powerful technique for combining many variables in an equation to predict a single outcome, the same way that many different streams can all combine into a single river. We’ll do this by looking at an example based on a data science salary survey. So this is based on real data, and the coefficients are based on the actual analysis, although I’m only showing a few of the variables that went into the equation. What the researchers found is that you could predict a person’s salary in data science by first starting with a value of $30500 per year, that’s the intercept, and then for each year above 18, so take their age and subtract 18, you add $1400, and then to that you add $5900 for each point on a five point bargaining scale, from one to five, so people who are better at bargaining made more money each year, and to that you can add $380 for each hour of the week that they work through the year. Taken together, you can combine that information, age and bargaining ability and time spent working, to make a single prediction about their salary working in data science. It’s an easy way to take these multiple sources and combine them using this rule which comes from the data that you fed it to know how to best predict the one outcome. Another method that’s frequently used in data science is what’s called a decision tree. This is a whole series, a sequence of binary decisions, based on your data, that can combine to predict an outcome. It’s called a tree because it branches out from one decision to the next, and in this example we’ll look at a simple analysis of the classic data set on classifying iris flowers as one of three different species depending on the length and the width of the petal and the sepal, and the decision tree looks like this. It’s extremely simple because there’s only four variables in the data set. But what you start with is, based on the analysis, is the single most important thing is to first know what is the length of the petal, and if the petal is less than or equal to 1.9 centimeters, then we would predict that 100% of them are going to be iris setosa, that’s a particular species. On the other hand, if the length of the petal is more than 1.9 centimeters, we have to make another decision. That’s, we have to look at the width of the petal, and if that width is less than or equal to 1.7 centimeters, then we need to look at the length of the petal again, and if it’s less than or equal to 4.8 centimeters, then there’s a very high probability that it’s a versicolor, and the algorithm used to calculate this does this by finding out which variable split produced the best predictions, and then do you need to split them any more. So it’s not like somebody sat down and said I think length is most important, let’s do that first, instead, the data drove the entire decision, and you’ll notice by the way, there’s only two variables in this. There’s petal length which appears twice, and petal width. The two other variables in the dataset, the sepal length and the sepal width, don’t work into it at all, not in this simple model, and what this lets you do is it lets you have a data-driven method of classifying observations into one case or another. You can then feed that into your algorithm and use it to process new information. Again, either approach, linear regression, decision trees, or so many others, can give you the information you need for data-based decision making, either in-person, or as a part of your data science algorithms, and that will get you on your way.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-generation-of-implicit-rules">3. The generation of implicit rules</h2>

<p>When the aliens land, we’ll have a better chance of understanding them because of our experience with machine learning and artificial intelligence. AI doesn’t see things the way that people do and it doesn’t reason the way that people do. For example, DeepMind’s AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero are three generations of AIs that have come to completely master the game, Go, which is massively more complex than chess. But these AI’s beat all of their opponents, not by mimicking the moves of human Go masters, but by coming up with their own unorthodox, but extremely effective strategies. One computer science researcher described these AI’s game play in these terms. “It’s like an alien civilization inventing “its own mathematics which allows it “to do things like time travel.” So, there’s something very significant going on here. And part of the issue is this. Neural networks, a particularly powerful kind of machine learning technique, can do amazing things with games, and can also quickly spot differences between, for example, two closely related breeds of dogs, like the English Mastiff and the French Mastiff. Humans will tell you that the English Mastiff is generally larger in size, about 200 pounds, with a large muzzle and often with a distinctive black mask. Whereas the French Mastiff is not quite so huge, tends to have a shorter muzzle, and slight different coloration. Neural networks, on the other hand, can distinguish these two breeds reliably, but because of the peculiar things they focus on, may have trouble distinguishing either of them, perhaps, from an image of a toaster that has certain pixels strategically doctored. And you can see the course, AI Accountability Essential Training, if you want to learn more about the peculiarities of AI vision. Neural networks look at things in a different way than humans do and in certain situations they’re able to develop rules for classification, even when humans can’t see anything more than static. So, for instance, there are implicit rules. The algorithm knows what the decision rules are and can apply them to new cases, even if the rules tend to be extraordinarily complex. But computers are able to keep track of these things better than humans can. So the implicit rules are rules that help the algorithms function. They are the rules that they develop by analyzing the test data. And they’re implicit because they cannot be easily described to humans. They may rely on features that humans can’t even detect or they may be nonsensical to humans. But the trick is, those implicit rules can still be very effective and that’s one of the tricks, that’s one of the trade-offs that goes on with machine learning. You can think of it this way. It leaves you, as a human decision-maker, in an interesting position. You can trust the machine to do its work very quickly and often very accurately, but in a slightly mysterious way. Relying on implicit rules that it, the algorithm inferred from the data, or you can use other, more explicit processes, like regression and decision trees that are easier to understand and monitor, but may not be as effective overall. It’s a difficult decision, but one that should definitely be left in the hands of the humans.</p>
