I"“<p>Nam Do-san, Kim Yong-san and Lee Chul-san, three members of the SamsanTech, are working on computer vision - image recognition/classification, one field of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. This drama brought up the topic of technology as its main theme. Interesting?! (Thatâ€™s the reason why I decided to watch this film although I rarely concern about K-Drama.)</p>

<p><img src="../post_img/startup-kdrama-01.png" alt="Start-up K-Drama" /></p>

<p>ğŸ‘‰ âš  <em>Spoiler Alert. I suggest that you should watch the film before reading this post.</em></p>

<p>Three of them participated in a fictional machine learning competition called CODA, which is based in Silicon Valley. While they didnâ€™t expect much that they would win, they actually won it. SamsanTech gets famous. Investors visit their office to know more about their potential. However, all of the investors leave. Why?</p>

<p>Because SamsanTech doesnâ€™t actually have a clear business plan at all. They just have what we call â€œthe algorithmâ€, â€œthe high-accuracy prototypeâ€, â€œthe machine learning technologyâ€, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What Do-san and his friends care about: Optimize the algorithm, enhance the accuracy of the image recognition system.</li>
  <li>What investors care about: How this amazing technology can be monetized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Investors donâ€™t understand why â€œchanging the parameters or adding an extra layer to the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) improves its accuracyâ€. They only care that it works, that itâ€™s applicable to the real world, and that it earns money.</p>

<p>Therefore, what I got is:</p>

<h4 id="great-brains-and-amazing-technology-arent-enough">Great brains and amazing technology arenâ€™t enough.</h4>
<h4 id="a-start-up-needs-a-clear-goal-on-what-its-doing-and-how-it-will-generate-profit">A start-up needs a clear goal on what itâ€™s doing and how it will generate profit.</h4>

<p>Because itâ€™s a business, not a project in the university.</p>

<p>By the way (not relevant to this post), I must say one thing I donâ€™t like about this film is that Han Jiâ€‘pyeong is not the male protagonist. However, I suggest this drama, you should have a try.</p>
