I"ê<p>Three SamsanTech members, Nam Do-san, Kim Yong-san, and Lee Chul-san, are working on computer vision - image recognition/classification, an <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> field. The concept of technology was the main theme of this drama. Isn‚Äôt it intriguing?! (It‚Äôs for this reason that I opted to watch this film, despite the fact that I‚Äôm not usually interested in K-Drama.)</p>
