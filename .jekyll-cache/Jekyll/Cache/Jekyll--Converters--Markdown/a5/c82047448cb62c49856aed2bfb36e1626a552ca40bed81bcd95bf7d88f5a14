<ul>
  <li>We use computers everyday</li>
  <li>Inside a computer are “0s and 1s”
    <ul>
      <li>Computers use the binary number system to represent info
        <ul>
          <li>How do computers represent info with just binary?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider the decimal number (what we human typically use) 123
    <ul>
      <li>The rightmost column is the 1s column</li>
      <li>The middle, the 10s</li>
      <li>The leftmost, the 100s</li>
      <li>Thus we have 100 x 1 + 10 x 2 + 1 x 3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inside a computer, the binary 000 would represent 0, just like in our human world!
    <ul>
      <li>However, in this case we are dealing with binary so:
        <ul>
          <li>The right most column is the 1s place</li>
          <li>The middle, the 2s</li>
          <li>The leftmost, the 4s</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In the human world (decimal) we use powers of 10 for place values</li>
      <li>In the computer world (binary) we use powers of 2 for place values</li>
      <li>The difference between decimal numbers and binary numbers is changing the base</li>
      <li>For the binary number 000, we have 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider the binary number 001:
    <ul>
      <li>We have 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do we represent the decimal number 2 in binary?
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t need a 4, be we need a 2, and also no 1</li>
      <li>This gives us 4 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 0 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Likewise, the number 3 would be:
    <ul>
      <li>As we need a 2 and a 1</li>
      <li>Thus, 4 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 1 = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Similarly, 4 would be:</li>
  <li>What about 7?
    <ul>
      <li>Which yields 4 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 1 x 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What about 8?
    <ul>
      <li>We can’t count to 8 without another bit (binary digit)
        <ul>
          <li>We run into this in the real world too if we need a four-digit number vs a 3-digit number
            <ul>
              <li>Start with the 1s, 10s, 100s place and add the 1000s</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Here we’ll add the next power of 2, 8</li>
          <li>8 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 0 = 8</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even though computers only use binary, they can count as high as humans can!
    <ul>
      <li>They do it with a smaller vocabulary, just 1 and 0.
        <ul>
          <li>This is because it’s easier to represent two states in the physical world
            <ul>
              <li>If you think of one of these bits as being a light bulb:
                <ul>
                  <li>0 is off</li>
                  <li>1 is on</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Light bulbs just need electricity to turn on or off</li>
              <li>Electricity is sufficient to turn a switch on or off
                <ul>
                  <li>Inside a computer exists these switches called transistors
                    <ul>
                      <li>Modern computers have billions!</li>
                      <li>Turned off represents 0</li>
                      <li>Turned on represents 1</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using these transistors we can store values, store data, compute, and do everything we can with computers</li>
  <li>David demonstrates how transistors work using light bulbs</li>
  <li>So far all that we can represent is numbers
    <ul>
      <li>A decision needs to be made on what pattern of 1s and 0s to represent letters, words, and paragraphs</li>
      <li>All computers can store is 0s and 1s</li>
      <li>To represent letters, we need a mapping of 0s and 1s to characters
        <ul>
          <li>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) does this</li>
          <li>65 -&gt; A, 66 -&gt; B, 67 -&gt; C, etc.</li>
          <li>97 -&gt; a, 98 -&gt; b, 99 -&gt; c, etc.</li>
          <li>ASCII also has mapping for punctuation symbols</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Programs like notepad, textedit, and MicroSoft Word decide weather to display patterns of bits as letters or words
        <ul>
          <li>Computers only store 0s and 1s, but the programs interpret those bits in a certain way
            <ul>
              <li>For example, if MicroSoft word sees a pattern of buts representing the number 65, it will interpret that as “A”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ASCII is limited
        <ul>
          <li>Original ASCII is 7 bits, thus giving 128 characters
            <ul>
              <li>Extended ASCII is 8 bits, yielding 256 characters</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Many symbols are not represented</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>UNICODE is a bigger set of characters that includes written languages other than English and even emoji! 😲
        <ul>
          <li>All are still represented by a pattern of bits</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider this pattern of bits: 01001000 01001001
    <ul>
      <li>16 bits or 2 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits)</li>
      <li>Using ASCII we get the word “HI”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cpu"><strong>CPU</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you have heard that your computer has “Intel Inside,” it has an Intel processor in it
    <ul>
      <li>The backside of the processor has pins that connect into the motherboard
        <ul>
          <li>The motherboard is a circuit board made of silicon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The CPU is the brain of the computer
    <ul>
      <li>Does all the thinking</li>
      <li>Performs math in numbers fed to it</li>
      <li>Helps display numbers on a screen</li>
      <li>Adds or deletes numbers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CPUs now can have multiple cores
    <ul>
      <li>Cores are the devices inside the CPU that can preform mathematical operations, load info from memory, save info to memory, etc.</li>
      <li>The more cores, the more tasks a CPU can do at once</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CPUs now also support hyper-threading
    <ul>
      <li>Where a single core will present itself as multiple cores to a computer’s operating system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Systems on a Chip (SoaC) are when a CPU and more are all interconnected at once rather than attached to a motherboard
    <ul>
      <li>Popular in phones, tables, and game consoles</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi</li>

          <li>GHz is the number of operations a CPU can perform per second (in billions)
            <ul>
              <li>1.94 GHz = 1.94 billion operations per second</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Logical processors in this case is 4, which means both cores support hyper-threading

<h2 id="hard-drives"><strong>Hard Drives</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>When you turn a computer off, you need a place to store data
    <ul>
      <li>A hard disk drive (HDD) stores this information</li>
      <li>RAM may store 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, through 16 GB or so</li>
      <li>HDD stores 256 GB, 1024 GB (AKA terabyte or TB), 2 TB</li>
      <li>Inside a HDD, metal platters physically spin around
        <ul>
          <li>Data is stored on these disks</li>
          <li>The reading heads move back and forth reading data from the device</li>
          <li>Uses tiny magnetic particles where north pole orientation represents 1 and south pole orientation represents 0
            <ul>
              <li>Power is only needed to read or change the data
                <ul>
                  <li>Data is preserved when power is off</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>David shows a video of a HDD running in slowmo</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To store data in a hard drive, RAM sends data and instructions to the HDD
    <ul>
      <li>The hard drive translates that data into voltage fluctuations
        <ul>
          <li>Some signals spin the platters, others move the read/write heads</li>
          <li>Pulses sent to the read/write head turn on a magnet which creates a field that changes the polarity of a tiny portion of the metal platter’s surface</li>
          <li>Power is sent in different directions as to change polarity</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To read, the particles on the disk use their charge to move the read/write head.</li>
      <li>Pieces of a file can be spread out around the platters
        <ul>
          <li>A special file keeps track of data’s location</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Anytime you have a physical device that moves over a period of time, things go wrong
        <ul>
          <li>Dropping a HDD can corrupt files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Platters spin slower than how fast electrons move</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="flash-memory"><strong>Flash Memory</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solid state disk (SSD)
    <ul>
      <li>Smaller (3.5 inch width for HDD vs 2.5 inch width for SSD)
        <ul>
          <li>Still fits where old HDDs are</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No moving particles</li>
      <li>Inside, it looks a lot like RAM</li>
      <li>Much faster than HDD
        <ul>
          <li>Programs/files load and save more quickly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>SSD theoretically don’t last as long as HDD
        <ul>
          <li>Finite number of writes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hybrid Drives
    <ul>
      <li>Some GB of solid state memory and more GB or TB of HDD space</li>
      <li>Stores as much of frequently-needed data on the SSD</li>
      <li>Stores less frequently-needed data on HDD</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Flash memory also exists in the form of USB sticks
    <ul>
      <li>Might store 1 GB, 16 GB, or more</li>
      <li>Portable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>External SSDs exist for more storage
    <ul>
      <li>Might store 256 GB or more</li>
      <li>Can be used to share data with others without network usage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can also have external HDD</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-memory-and-funneling"><strong>Types of Memory and Funneling</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is a tradeoff between space, money, and speed of data transfer
    <ul>
      <li>Data is pushed “down the funnel” to your CPU
        <ul>
          <li>From the hard drive, data first goes to the RAM</li>
          <li>Theoretically, the CPU never has to wait for data to crunch</li>
          <li>There is a tiny amount of memory (bytes) called registers where numbers are stored for operations.</li>
          <li>Memory at the bottom is more expensive</li>
          <li>Disk is important for the long-term storage</li>
          <li>RAM is important as it stores programs you use simultaneously</li>
          <li>L3, L2, L1 cache are on the motherboard</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As an analogy for memory, picture a candy store
    <ul>
      <li>A customer approaches the counter and requests candy</li>
      <li>The shop owner then leaves the counter to grab the candy before returning moments later
        <ul>
          <li>Not super efficient to walk all the way to the store room to grab candy
            <ul>
              <li>Better to have a cache of memory</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Instead, the shop owner leaves the counter to ready a cache of candy before the customers arrive</li>
      <li>When a customer comes, the candy can be distributed quickly
        <ul>
          <li>Cache memory similarly helps the CPU in this manner</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We can see sizes of cache looking at computer specs like before</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="display-connectors"><strong>Display Connectors</strong></h2>

  <li>USB-C is newer and can be plugged in coming from different directions</li>
  <li>Other variants often exist for phones</li>
  <li>Older USB connections are slower when transferring data
    <ul>
      <li>Hard drives can connect via USB

<h2 id="operating-system-os"><strong>Operating System (OS)</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Software that ensures all devices work and can intercommunicate</li>
  <li>MacOS and Windows are popular OS</li>
  <li>Can be installed by the user, but is typically done so by a manufacturer
