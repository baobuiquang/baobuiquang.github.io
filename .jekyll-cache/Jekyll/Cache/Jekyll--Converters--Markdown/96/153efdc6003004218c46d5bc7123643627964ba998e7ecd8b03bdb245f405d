<ul>
  <li>Keeping people away from things you don‚Äôt want them to see</li>
  <li>Computers are among the lease secure devices you own
    <ul>
      <li>Data or files are stored on them as 0s and 1s
        <ul>
          <li>Can be financial info, photos, etc.</li>
        </ul>

<h2 id="deleting-files"><strong>Deleting Files</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to delete a file off of a hard drive?
    <ul>
      <li>Visually, it disappears from a desktop or folder</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Files are stored on a computer as 0s and 1s</li>
  <li>Some space needs to be allocated for the file</li>
  <li>The operating system has a file that keeps track of files an their location on disk</li>
  <li>Graphically, when a file is deleted, it moves to the trash (or recycle bin)
    <ul>
      <li>It can still be easily revived from here, until you empty the trash</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>However, an operating system doesn‚Äôt actually delete it from the hard drive
    <ul>
      <li>It simply forgets the location and existence of the file!</li>
      <li>One can theoretically recover data by looking for familiar patterns of bits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>So how do we delete more securely?
    <ul>
      <li>Re-saving a file with overridden information actually could not override the old bits but rather create more 0s and 1s stored on a hard drive!</li>
      <li>Special software can wipe data off of a hard drive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Who do computers have this obvious flaw with deleting?
    <ul>
      <li>What if we accidentally delete a file?
        <ul>
          <li>This structure allows for recovery</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wiping data also takes a lot of time, so it‚Äôs much faster to just forget locations of data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cookies"><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>A feature supported by HTTP</li>
  <li>Little values a web server puts on a user‚Äôs browser</li>
  <li>Used to remember if a user has visited a website before
    <ul>
      <li>Allows you to not have to log in every time you visit or refresh a page
        <ul>
          <li>When you log into a web server, a cookie is planted on your browser</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Stored in a database</li>
      <li>Browser will send value to web server to remind of previous login</li>

  <li>A cookie is like an ink-based hand stamp for an amusement park or club</li>
  <li>Wireless information can be intercepted
    <ul>
      <li>What if a hacker could obtain the cookie
        <ul>
          <li>Session hijacking attack</li>
          <li>If you have already logged in, hacker can pretend to be you</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Encryption scrambles this value so hackers cannot easily use it</li>
  <li>Browser history remembers everywhere you‚Äôve been and everything you‚Äôve done there
    <ul>
      <li>Convenient if you want to recall a website you‚Äôve visited

          <li>But, so can anyone else with access to your browser</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can clear browser history and cookies
    <ul>
      <li>History likely not securely scrubbed</li>
      <li>Will protect you from nosey friends</li>
      <li>Websites will forget you visited as the cookies will be deleted as well!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incognito-mode"><strong>Incognito Mode</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can open up a typically different colored browser window</li>
  <li>Use if you want history automatically removed</li>
  <li>Useful when building a website as sometimes you want a browser to forget old iterations of your website build</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="authentication"><strong>Authentication</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>All of this assumes you log in</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt use a passcode to protect your device, anyone can pretend to be you

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="passwords"><strong>Passwords</strong></h2>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On many smartphones, you will have to wait for an amount of time if you have entered a bad passcode
    <ul>
      <li>Slows down the process of someone guessing</li>
    </ul>

      <li>You could forget it</li>
      <li>Annoying to type in repetitively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No one fits all
    <ul>
      <li>Short = bad, longer = good</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt use popular words and phrases
        <ul>
          <li>Hackers will look for words or common phrases</li>
        </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Hackers have dictionaries of bad passwords that they can search through and try</li>
  <li>Random passwords
    <ul>
      <li>Usually have to confirm so it can be hard to replicate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using numbers to represent letter is common
    <ul>
      <li>1 for l</li>
      <li>4 for A</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It‚Äôs suggested you mix uppercase, lowercase, and and throw in numbers
    <ul>
      <li>Good to use misspellengs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt put your post-it with your password on your monitor!</li>
  <li>Constant password changes can be a net negative
    <ul>
      <li>Can encourage easier passwords to help with memorization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="password-resetting"><strong>Password Resetting</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>What if you forget your password?
    <ul>
      <li>Often can click on a link to reset your password
        <ul>
          <li>Asks you to type email address or username</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Typically, you get an email with a link
        <ul>
          <li>Hopefully this goes back to the same website!</li>
          <li>It likely has a random value in the URL</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once back at the website, you update your password</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The website has a database
    <ul>
      <li>It generated a random number and stored it with a note indicating password recovery</li>
      <li>The website assumes that anyone who has access to this value and to the user‚Äôs email is you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Typically, tech staff can‚Äôt tell you what your password is
    <ul>
      <li>Odds are your password is encrypted (scrambled) or, more technically, hashed in their database</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting a password in email means that the password are not hashed or encrypted!
    <ul>
      <li>Also, sending a password over email opens that email to interception</li>
      <li>This is a red flag if a website does this</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-the-same-password"><strong>Using The Same Password</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may have a favorite password that you reuse
    <ul>
      <li>Upside is that it‚Äôs convenient</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>However, what if one of the websites are hacked?
    <ul>
      <li>A hacker may try to use the password on other websites to see what she or he can get into!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="password-managers"><strong>Password Managers</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Difficult to remember all these passwords</li>
  <li>Software called password managers exist that store on your phone or hard drive all usernames and passwords in an encrypted way
    <ul>
      <li>You have a master password that logs you into everywhere!
        <ul>
          <li>Store it physically in somewhere like a safety deposit box</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Password managers create long random passwords and will log in for you
    <ul>
      <li>All websites have different passwords!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>However, if you lose the master password, you cannot get the accounts back!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="two-factor-authentication"><strong>Two Factor Authentication</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>First factor is a password
    <ul>
      <li>Historically, something ‚Äúonly‚Äù the user knows</li>
      <li>Can be guessed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Second factor should be fundamentally different
    <ul>
      <li>Should be something you have
        <ul>
          <li>An RSA device displays a unique value that is synced with a server
            <ul>
              <li>This number needs to be typed in too!</li>
              <li>As long as this device isn‚Äôt stolen by someone with your password, they can‚Äôt get in as easily</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Phones now run software that allows you to get a code and type them in</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should think about what websites you care about the most and enable two factor authentication
    <ul>
      <li>Some companies can use sms (text messages)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="network-security"><strong>Network security</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>So many of our current networks are wireless
    <ul>
      <li>You probably been conditioned to look for free wifi
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes still might not connect for various reasons</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the wireless connection has not padlock (no password to log in) the connection is not secure
    <ul>
      <li>You may still visit https or secure websites</li>
      <li>However, everything you do on http sites can be seen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What to do?
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt use that network</li>
      <li>Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)
        <ul>
          <li>Connection to internet is encrypted
            <ul>
              <li>With an unsecured connection, anyone can access your data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vpn"><strong>VPN</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>First establish encrypted connection to a server and let this server communicate for you
    <ul>
      <li>The connection between the VPN server and website can still be insecure!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Because we are encrypting data through an algorithm, using a VPN can slow down speed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="firewall"><strong>Firewall</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>A physical firewall is a wall between connected buildings that prevents the spread of fire</li>
  <li>In the world of computer science, a firewall is software that looks at IP addresses and helps keep bad guys out and user data inside</li>
  <li>Helps prevent people from accessing your computer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="encryption"><strong>Encryption</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose I want to send a secret message for ‚ÄúHI‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>HI ‚ûü IJ</li>
      <li>Change each letter by 1</li>
      <li>The recipient needs to know how it changed to revert</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plaintext ‚ûü Cyphertext ‚ûü Plaintext
    <ul>
      <li>HI ‚ûü IJ ‚ûü HI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is called a caesar cypher
    <ul>
      <li>Rotational cyphers are not that secure
        <ul>
          <li>Can be guessed easily</li>
          <li>Not used for internet encryption</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For this to work, recipient needs the key
        <ul>
          <li>To know the key, we need to agree in advance
            <ul>
              <li>Can‚Äôt send it encrypted as well as they need the key!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="public-key-cryptography"><strong>Public Key Cryptography</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The last example with a caesar cypher is secret-key cryptography
    <ul>
      <li>Only one key</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In public key cryptography there are two keys, one public and one private
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematical relationship between them</li>
      <li>Use public key to encrypt, private key to decrypt</li>
      <li>Bob‚Äôs private key can undo the effects of his public key</li>
      <li>When Bob responds‚Ä¶</li>
      <li>Bob sends a message using Alice‚Äôs public key</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your browser has its own public and private keys
    <ul>
      <li>So does websites like Google and Amazon
        <ul>
          <li>This allows them to communicate securely with you</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Often this processes is used to exchange a secret key</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phishing"><strong>Phishing</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>These kind of attacks have become so prevent that the following has been posted around Harvard‚Äôs campus</li>
  <li>Phishing attacks are when an adversary sends a somewhat official-looking email
    <ul>
      <li>May contain a link asking for a password or account info</li>
      <li>The email may contain an elaborate backstory ‚Äújustifying‚Äù the request</li>
      <li>The malicious email is trying to obtain information from you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Odds are that the link provided doesn‚Äôt go to the website being claimed
    <ul>
      <li>Can go to a website that looks legit
        <ul>
          <li>People can just copy HTML</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Results in giving up private information</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs healthy to distrust most email you get
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt follow links, type in the address for the company yourself</li>
      <li>Sketchy emails may have typographical errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="malware"><strong>Malware</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Malicious software can also be sent via email</li>
  <li>Windows is particularly vulnerable</li>
  <li>Software can be injected into your browser and your computer to erase your hard drive, make your computer send spam, or hold your data hostage</li>
  <li>Some malware encrypts your data and asks for large sums of money to get the key to decrypt it
    <ul>
      <li>Key could not even work!</li>
      <li>This is called ransomware</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Malware can ultimately do anything on your computer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trust"><strong>Trust</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>At the end of the day, all of security and privacy boils down to trust
    <ul>
      <li>People around you</li>
      <li>Algorithms/software</li>
      <li>Manufacturers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We‚Äôve downloaded software with trust that it will only do what it claims
    <ul>
      <li>Word could log your key strokes</li>
      <li>Chrome could monitor you even when not on Google‚Äôs website</li>
      <li>Snapchat could not delete posts after being seen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There have been cases where software was written to cover tracks of being monitored!</li>
  <li>Who‚Äôs to say the software we‚Äôre using is actually doing what we say?</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs east to curl up into a ball and worry, but we need to decide who to trust</li>
  <li>Security measures make it more difficult for someone to be malicious, but ultimately they can‚Äôt guarantee privacy</li>
  <li>You have to decide what data you‚Äôre comfortable with storing, what you view on the internet, who to trust, and how much to trust them</li>
</ul>
