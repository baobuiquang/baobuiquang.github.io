I"|<p>Nam Do-san, Kim Yong-san and Lee Chul-san, three members of the SamsanTech, are working on computer vision - image recognition/classification, one field of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. This drama brought up the topic of technology as its main theme. Interesting?! (Thatâ€™s the reason why I decided to watch this film although I rarely concern about K-Drama.)</p>
