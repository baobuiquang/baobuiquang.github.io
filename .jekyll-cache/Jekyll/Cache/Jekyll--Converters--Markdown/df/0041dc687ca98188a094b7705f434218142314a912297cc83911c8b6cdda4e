<ul>
  <li>Computers are good at recording, playing back, and generating audio</li>
  <li>Uses different file formats
    <ul>
      <li>File formats are just a way of storing 0s and 1s on disk so that certain software knows how to interpret it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MIDI
    <ul>
      <li>Way of storing musical notes for certain songs</li>
      <li>Can do this for different instruments
        <ul>
          <li>Programs can render the notes for these instruments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GarageBand
    <ul>
      <li>Included with macOS</li>
      <li>This is the Star Wars theme in MIDI
        <ul>
          <li>Doesnâ€™t sound quite as good as the actual version</li>
          <li>Computer synthesizes the notes
            <ul>
              <li>Not an actual recording</li>
              <li>Computer interprets notes in the MIDI file</li>
            </ul>

  <li>MIDI is common in the digital workspace among musicians who wish to share music with each other.</li>
  <li>Humans typically like to hear music preformed and recorded by humans
    <ul>
      <li>File formats for recorded music include:
        <ul>
          <li>AAC</li>
          <li>MIDI</li>
          <li>MP3</li>
          <li>WAV</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>WAV is an early sound format, but still used
    <ul>
      <li>Uncompressed data storage allowing high quality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MP3
    <ul>
      <li>File format for audio that uses compression
        <ul>
          <li>Significantly reduce how many bits are necessary to store a song</li>
          <li>Discards 0s and 1s that humans canâ€™t necessarily hear
            <ul>
              <li>True audiophiles may disagree</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Trade off between optimizing storage space and sacrificing quality</li>
          <li>This compression is said to be lossy
            <ul>
              <li>Losing the quality in the compression process</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AAC
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to MP3</li>
      <li>May see when you download a song from iTunes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Streaming services such as Spotify donâ€™t transfer a file to you but rather stream bits of information to you</li>
  <li>How do we think about the quality of these formats?
    <ul>
      <li>Sampling frequency
        <ul>
          <li>Number of times per seconds we take a digital snapshot of what a person would hear</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bit depth
        <ul>
          <li>Number of bits used for these individual snapshots</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sampling frequency x bit depth = number of bits necessary to store one second of music</li>
      <li>Audio file formats allow you to modify what these parameters are</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
