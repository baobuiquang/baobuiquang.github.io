preview: "Analysis, the process of turning raw data into insights, provide us with a view of how Coronavirus disease influences the communities, indicate if the development of a country affects its virus spread as well as the infection rate, the death rate and the recovered rate. Diagnosis method is potential in preventing the spread of the pandemic. With the dataset of chest X-ray, we can build a Machine Learning model to predict if a new X-ray image is from COVID-19 infected or non-infected."

### COVID-19 virus pandemic
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious global disease. The virus was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
### Analysis and Diagnosis of COVID-19
Analysis, or the process of turning raw data into insights, can provide us with a view of how the virus influences the communities. Those insights can indicate if the development of a country affects its virus spread as well as the relationship between the infection rate, the death rate and the recovered rate of COVID-19 pandemic in some specific countries and on the global.

The quick diagnosis method is significant in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the dataset of approximately 1000 images of chest X-ray collected, we can build a machine learning model to predict whether a new X-ray image is from a COVID-19 infected patient or a non-infected person.
