Nam Do-san, Kim Yong-san and Lee Chul-san, three members of the SamsanTech, are working on computer vision - image recognition/classification, one field of **artificial intelligence**. This drama brought up the topic of technology as its main theme. Interesting?! (That's the reason why I decided to watch this film although I rarely concern about K-Drama.)

ðŸ‘‰ âš  *Spoiler Alert. I suggest that you should watch the film before reading this post.*

Three of them participated in a fictional machine learning competition called CODA, which is based in Silicon Valley. While they didnâ€™t expect much that they would win, they actually won it. SamsanTech gets famous. Investors visit their office to know more about their potential. However, all of the investors leave. Why?

Because SamsanTech doesn't actually have a clear business plan at all. They just have what we call "the algorithm", "the high-accuracy prototype", "the machine learning technology", etc.

* What Do-san and his friends care about: Optimize the algorithm, enhance the accuracy of the image recognition system.
* What investors care about: How this amazing technology can be monetized. 

Investors donâ€™t understand why "changing the parameters or adding an extra layer to the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) improves its accuracy". They only care that it works, that itâ€™s applicable to the real world, and that it earns money.

Therefore, what I got is:

#### Great brains and amazing technology arenâ€™t enough.
#### A start-up needs a clear goal on what itâ€™s doing and how it will generate profit.

Because itâ€™s a business, not a project in the university.

By the way (not relevant to this post), I must say one thing I don't like about this film is that Han Jiâ€‘pyeong is not the male protagonist. However, I suggest this drama, you should have a try.
